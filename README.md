In this project, I designed algorithms that:
1. take a String input and create a new graph accordingly
2. add an edge between vertices
3. return all directed edges in a graph showing both the predecessors and successors

Also, I implemented iterative Breadth First Search, and both iterative and recursive Depth First Search aglorithms.
