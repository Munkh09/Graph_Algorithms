In this project, I designed algorithms that:
1. take a String input and creates a new graph accordingly
2. add an edge between vertices
3. return all directed edges in a graph showing both the predecessors and successors

Also, I implemented iterative Breadth First Search, recursive Depth First Search, as well as Iterative Depth First Search.
